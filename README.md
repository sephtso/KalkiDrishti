**KalkiDrishti** (क्ल्कि दृष्टि) is an intelligent crime prediction system that uses machine learning to analyze temporal and geospatial crime data from the city of Guwahati, India. It forecasts likely criminal activities, identifies crime hotspots, and enables role-based access for civilians and law enforcement to collaborate in reporting and analyzing incidents.  

Developed as part of a final-year B.Tech project at Assam Down Town University, this solution leverages classification algorithms such as **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests** for predicting crime categories based on **timestamp**, **location**, and **IPC sections**.
